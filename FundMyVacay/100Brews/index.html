			Mikkeller. Known for brewing awesome beer, however, Beer Geek Breakfast is my introduction to the man. This beer pours black with a thick tan head. From the get-go it looks like this is going to be quite heavy.
Yet, when you take the first sip, you're greeted with hops, chocolate, and oatmeal notes that aren't too overpowering. The shocking part of drinking Beer Geek Breakfast is how 'not heavy' and dry it feels. This is attributable to the hefty amount of carbonation here. It may sound off-putting, but the carbonation makes this beer extremely drinkable for an oatmeal stout. 
	<br><br>
The finish just may be the best part of Breakfast. The taste of roasted coffee and bitter chocolate are left on the tip of your tongue leaving you wanting more. Well done Mikkeller, looking forward to the next brew.
