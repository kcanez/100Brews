Taste
	Dry, roastey, coffee.
	
	Looks like its going to be very heavy with harsh chocolate and coffee notes,
	But actually feels very light (probably due to some heavy carbonation)
	
Finish
	Finishes with a mild roasted coffee/smokey taste, isnt overpowering when you put it down,
	And the more you drink the more the taste evens out in your mouth.

Appearance/smell
	Very dark with a dark mocha/latte foam

Drinkability
	Shockingly drinkable for being an oatmeal stout. Very dry and hoppy. chocolate and coffee dont overpower

Mikkeller. Known for brewing awesome beer, however, Beer Geek Breakfast is my introduction to the man.
This beer pours black with a thick tan head. From the get-go it looks like this is going to be quite heavy.
Yet, when you take the first sip, you're greeted with hops, chocolate, and oatmeal notes that aren't too
overpowering. The shocking part of drinking Beer Geek Breakfast is how 'not heavy' and dry it feels. This is
attributable to the hefty amount of carbonation here. It may sound offputting, but the carbonation makes this
beer extremely drinkable for an oatmeal stout. 
	
The finish just may be the best part of Breakfast. The taste of roasted coffee and bitter chocolate are left
on the tip of your tongue leaving you wanting more. Well done Mikkeller, looking forward to the next brew.

Summary ->
	Tastes similar to a most oatmeal stouts but is shockingly drinkable. The hops and coffee notes shine
	bright as you drink, but the roasted coffee finish makes the beer. If I had to complain about one thing
	It would be the carbonation in this stout, on one hand it makes the beer 100 times more drinkable,
	but on the other I am going to be feeling this one for a while.
